# Reading Strategies for English Comprehension

To succeed in English reading sections of the entrance exam, you need both understanding and a smart approach. Here are proven strategies to help you read faster, find answers more easily, and avoid common mistakes.

---

## 1. Read the Questions First

- **Why:** Knowing the questions helps you focus on what information to look for.
- **How:**  
  1. Skim all the questions quickly.
  2. Underline keywords (names, times, places, actions).
  3. Keep these questions in mind as you read the text.

---

## 2. Skim for the Main Idea

- **Why:** Understanding the general topic saves time and reduces confusion.
- **How:**  
  - Read the title, first sentence, and last sentence of the passage.
  - Ask yourself: "What is this text mostly about?"

---

## 3. Scan for Details

- **Why:** Many questions ask for specific facts (numbers, names, dates).
- **How:**  
  - Move your eyes quickly through the text to spot keywords from the questions.
  - Don’t read every word—jump to the needed part.

---

## 4. Use Context Clues for Unknown Words

- **Why:** You won’t always know every word.  
- **How:**  
  - Look at the sentence before and after.
  - Use pictures (if any), headings, and related words to guess the meaning.
  - Don’t panic—understand the general meaning.

---

## 5. Eliminate Wrong Answers

- **Why:** Multiple-choice questions often have tricky options.
- **How:**  
  - Cross out answers that do not match the information in the passage.
  - Double-check for words like “always”, “never”, or “only”—these are often wrong.

---

## 6. Answer in Simple Sentences

- **Why:** Short, clear answers get full points and save time.
- **How:**  
  - Use information from the text.
  - Avoid copying long sentences—paraphrase if possible.

---

## 7. Check Your Answers

- **Why:** Simple mistakes can cost points.
- **How:**  
  - Re-read your answers to be sure they make sense.
  - Check spelling and grammar for written answers.

---

## 8. Practice with Timing

- **Why:** The real exam is limited in time.
- **How:**  
  - Set a timer when practicing.
  - Try to finish each passage and questions in the allowed time.

---

## 9. Sample Mini Practice

> **Read the passage and answer the questions:**  
> "Tom likes apples and oranges. He eats fruit every morning before school."  
> 1. What does Tom eat before school?  
> 2. Does Tom like apples?
